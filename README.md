# LakeSuperiorStreams

This project was completed by a team of four individuals as a class assignment. The project was coded entirely in C++. It is designed to process data from a CSV file and store it in chronological order. The stored data can then be queried by the user to search and sort certain values. 

## Goals
The primary goals of this project were as follows:

1. **Team Collaboration:** To practice coding in a team setting and improve collaborative skills.
2. **Version Control:** To practice the Git workflow for collaborative software development.
3. **Unit Testing:** To implement and practice unit testing, ensuring the robustness of the code.
4. **Data Processing:** To create a functional system capable of processing CSV data and performing user queries effectively.
5. **Code Quality:** To maintain proper code formatting, relevant comments, and documentation for ease of understanding and future development.

## Features
- CSV Data Processing: The system can read data from CSV files and store it in a structured format.
- Chronological Order: Data is stored and sorted in chronological order for efficient retrieval.
- User Queries: Users can query the stored data to search and sort specific values as needed.
- Unit Testing: Implemented unit tests to validate the code's functionality, especially handling unusual inputs to prevent crashes.
- Code Quality: Ensured proper formatting, relevant comments, and documentation for ease of maintenance and understanding.

## Technologies Used
- Language: C++
- Version Control: Git
- Testing Framework: CTest
